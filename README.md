# TinyGLES
A minimal single header and source file implementation of GLES. Mainly for use on systems that are NOT running a desktop

## RPi users note
As of 26 Match 2021 their distro installs the headers and libs in a non standard location, /opt/vc/include and /opt/vc/lib and so you may need to add these paths to your project if moving from a desktop system to a RPi.
